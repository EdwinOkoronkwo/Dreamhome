Yes, you need both validateBranchData and handleValidationResults together for the following reasons:
1. Separation of Concerns:

    validateBranchData: This middleware function performs the actual validation of incoming request data. It uses validation rules to check if the data meets the required criteria (e.g., checking if a field is a valid text or date). This middleware does not handle the response directly; it just performs the validation.

    handleValidationResults: This middleware function processes the results of the validation. It checks if there were any errors during validation and formats them into a response if errors are present. This middleware handles the response to the client and ensures that any validation errors are properly communicated.

2. Workflow:

    Validation Execution: validateBranchData runs first and performs validation checks on the incoming request data. It adds any validation errors to the request object.

    Error Handling: After validateBranchData completes its validation checks, handleValidationResults runs next. It reads the validation results added by validateBranchData and sends an appropriate response if there are validation errors.

Example Flow:

    Incoming Request: When a request hits the route, it first goes through validateBranchData.

    javascript

    router.post(
      "/",
      this.upload.single("image"),
      validateBranchData,  // Performs validation
      handleValidationResults,  // Handles the results of validation
      BranchController.addOrUpdateBranch
    );

    Validation Check: validateBranchData validates the request data and potentially adds errors to the request object if the data is invalid.

    Error Handling: handleValidationResults checks for these errors. If errors exist, it sends a response to the client indicating validation failures. If no errors are found, it calls the next middleware, which is BranchController.addOrUpdateBranch in this case.

Benefits:

    Modularity: Separating validation and error handling into different middlewares keeps your code modular and easier to maintain.
    Readability: It improves readability by clearly distinguishing between the logic for validation and the logic for handling validation results.
    Reusability: You can reuse handleValidationResults across different routes and controllers without repeating error handling logic.

In summary, using both validateBranchData and handleValidationResults together allows you to effectively manage validation and handle errors in a clean and structured way.
